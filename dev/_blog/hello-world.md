Well, that took a while, but the blog is finally up.

Setting up a Blog is a usually a piece of cake if you want it to be, but then, where's the fun in that right?

So I've taken the really long route and set it up from scratch. It doesn't use any CMS system. Instead it uses a tiny
but beautifully simple library called ```Poet```. I had to [fork it](https://github.com/piofthings/poet) because the [original library](http://jsantell.github.io/poet) looks like it needs some love.

I will write more about ```Poet``` in my software oriented [blog](http://sumitmaitra.wordpress.com).  

I shall keep this place solely for IoT projects, Robotics and 3D Printing related stuff.  

Okay, back to work now, we have robots to build and things to automate... cheers!
