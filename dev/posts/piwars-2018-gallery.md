Finally managed to collate all the images from friends and family who had come along to PiWars 2018. Here's a glimpse of Team Pi-O-Steer's action packed day at PiWars 2018.

A special mention to Anagha-Ilyas and family, Ankita-Pranab and family, Gauri-Saji and family, Rupali-Karthik and family and Sagar Mangalani for driving down Cambridge to support team Pi-o-steer. Thanks folks, love you all!
